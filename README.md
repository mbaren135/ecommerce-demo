This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## About the project

This is an ongoing personal project to demonstrate front-end development skills. The project uses [FakestoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to populate the store front with some immutable data. Some of the upcoming upgrades to the project include improved authentication, developing a product rating workflow, and implementing 'cart drop' functionality to allow products to be added to carts. Hopefully one day, the project will use a database to allow for new products/users and permanent data manipulation to create a more robust application.

### Tech
The project uses Framer Motion and TailwindCSS for the styling, and custom error handling is developed using the library [react-error-boundary](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary)
